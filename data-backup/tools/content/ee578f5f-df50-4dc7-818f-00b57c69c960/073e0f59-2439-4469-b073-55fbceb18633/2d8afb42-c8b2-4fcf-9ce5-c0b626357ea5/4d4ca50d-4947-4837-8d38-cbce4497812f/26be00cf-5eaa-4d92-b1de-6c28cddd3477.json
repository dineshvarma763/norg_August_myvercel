I called them last week to inquire about a problem with a remote control for my garage roller door. The gentleman Bill from their technical support was very professional and patient in helping me to go through tedious steps to fix the roller door which was jammed and not sync with the remote control. Finally we got it fixed after we spent a fair amount of time. I appreciate Bill's efforts and responsiveness in this matter. I highly recommend buying their product as you know you are going to get a good technical service if needed.</p>", "authorName": "Calvin Chin"}], "settingsData": []}}}
