The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) featured a staggering 309 Trillion, Trillion code combinations to protect against increasingly sophisticated code grabbing devices used by criminals to interfere with remote control systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Axess Pro Series 3000 Industrial Shutter Opener\u00a0</strong>\u2013 Released in 2011, Axess 3000 introduced universal operation to allow it to be mounted either on the left or right hand side without any modifications needed, addressing a key issue for the roller shutter industry.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy coding door remotes</strong> \u2013 Traditionally homeowners have needed to code in new remote Garage Door Remotes via buttons on the opener itself. As the opener is usually mounted on or close to the ceiling, this required a ladder. To minimize the hassle and improve safety we developed technology that allowed the home owner to code in additional remote Garage Door Remotes from their existing transmitter, removing the need to touch the opener itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Wireless Safety Beams\u00a0</strong>\u2013 Developed to protect your family, possessions and car, safety beams allow the garage door to stop and reverse as soon as an object or person moves through the invisible beam, averting damage or even injury. The wireless design also allows for easy, hassle free installation.</li>\n</ul>"}, "backgroundColour": {"$invariant": ""}, "selectableVariant": {"$invariant": []}, "order": {"$invariant": []}, "align": {"$invariant": []}}
