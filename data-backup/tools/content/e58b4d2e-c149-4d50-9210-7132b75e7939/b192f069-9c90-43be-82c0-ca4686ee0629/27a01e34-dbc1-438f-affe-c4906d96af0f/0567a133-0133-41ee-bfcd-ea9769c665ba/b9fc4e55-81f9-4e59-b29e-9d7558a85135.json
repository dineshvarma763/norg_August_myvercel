As the opener is usually mounted on or close to the ceiling, this required a ladder. To minimise the hassle and improve safety we developed technology that allowed the home owner to code in additional remote Garage Door Remotes from their existing transmitter, removing the need to touch the opener itself.</li>\n<li class=\"relative pl-3.5 before:block before:absolute before:left-0 before:top-3 before:rounded-full before:w-1 before:h-1 before:bg-black text-my-blue\"><strong>Wireless Safety Beams\u00a0</strong>\u2013 Developed to protect your family, possessions and car, safety beams allow the garage door to stop and reverse as soon as an object or person moves through the invisible beam, averting damage or even injury. The wireless design also allows for easy, hassle free installation.</li>\n</ul>", "editor": {"id": "b23b1540-e8c1-4bae-8d92-a5c8ba3fa543"}}]}]}]}]}}, "backgroundColour": {"$invariant": ""}, "selectableVariant": {"$invariant": []}, "order": {"$invariant": []}, "align": {"$invariant": []}}
