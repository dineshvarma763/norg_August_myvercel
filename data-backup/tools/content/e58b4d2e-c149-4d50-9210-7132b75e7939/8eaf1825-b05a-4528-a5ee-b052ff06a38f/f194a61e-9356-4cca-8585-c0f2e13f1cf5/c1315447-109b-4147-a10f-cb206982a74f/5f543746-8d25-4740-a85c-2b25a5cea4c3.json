I called them last week to inquire about the problem of remote control for my garage roller door. The gentleman Bill from their technical support was very professional and patient in helping me to go through tedious steps to fix the roller door which was jammed and not syn with the remote control. Finally we got it fixed after spent a fair amount of time. I appreciate Bill's efforts and responsiveness in this matter. I highly recommend anyone to buy their product as you know you are going to get a good technical service if needed.<br /><br /></p>", "authorName": "Calvin Chin "}, {"contentTypeKey": "506077c8-85bb-49c6-a786-6cdbb2ff6175", "udi": "umb://element/f8e704b26d1c4bb1bf639402788baf49", "testimonialTitle": "Testimonial 2", "testimonialDescription": "<p>Our business chooses to install Ata motors because we believe they are the best on the market, for both cost and longevity.
